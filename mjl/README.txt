The goals of this project are the following:

- Demonstrate knowledge and competency in C++14/17
- Demonstrate knowledge and competency in data structures
- Utilize literal wording of the English language with the goal of making this

- Provide usage statistics so that developers can analyze whether or not they
  are using the most efficient data structures for their situation.
