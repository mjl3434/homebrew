The goals of this project are the following:

- Demonstrate knowledge and competency in C++14/17
- Demonstrate knowledge and competency in data structures
- Utilize literal wording of the English language with the goal of making this
  library easier and more intuitive than the C++ standard template library.
- Provide usage statistics so that developers can analyze whether or not they
  are using the most efficient data structures for their situation.
  
  ToDo:
  -- Update test code to compare STL results to this library and programatically compare return true/false on tests
  -- Bidirectional iterators
  -- Doubly Linked List
  -- Hash Table
  -- Red-Black Tree
  -- Add statistical record keeping
